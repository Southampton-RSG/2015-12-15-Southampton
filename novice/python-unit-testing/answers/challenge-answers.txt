2. 
asserts in code
 - give more fine-grained monitoring of behaviour
 - give developers clear idea of what should be correct behaviour within the program itself
 - monitors behaviour at run-time

unit tests
 - treat thing to test as a black box; higher-level monitoring
 - separate from code, but should be maintained with the code
 - provides examples of how to invoke the code to do something
 - monitors behaviour outside of run-time
