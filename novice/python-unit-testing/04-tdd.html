<p>Libraries like <code>nose</code> can’t think of test cases for us. We still have to decide what to test and how many tests to run. Our best guide here is economics: we want the tests that are most likely to give us useful information that we don’t already have. For example, if <code>rectangle_area([0, 0, 1, 1])</code> works, there’s probably not much point testing <code>rectangle_area((0, 0, 2, 2))</code>, since it’s hard to think of a bug that would show up in one case but not in the other.</p>
<p>We should therefore try to choose tests that are as different from each other as possible, so that we force the code we’re testing to execute in all the different ways it can - to ensure our tests have a high degree of <em>code coverage</em>. Another way of thinking about this is that we should try to find <em>boundary cases</em>. If a function works for zero, one, and a million values, it will probably work for eighteen values.</p>
<p>Using boundary values as tests has another advantage: it can help us design our software. To see how, consider this test case for our rectangle area function, adding it to test_rectangle2.py and re-running <code>nosetests</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> test_inverted_rectangle():
    <span class="kw">assert</span> rectangle_area([<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>]) == -<span class="fl">12.0</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 0.001s

OK</code></pre>
<p>It passes the test, but is that test correct? i.e., are rectangles with <code>x1&lt;x0</code> or <code>y1&lt;y0</code> legal, and do they have negative area? Or should the test be:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> test_inverted_rectangle():
    <span class="kw">try</span>:
        rectangle_area([<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>])
        <span class="kw">assert</span> <span class="ot">False</span>, <span class="st">&#39;Function did not raise exception for invalid rectangle&#39;</span>
    <span class="kw">except</span> <span class="ot">ValueError</span>:
        <span class="kw">pass</span> <span class="co"># rectangle_area failed with the expected kind of exception</span>
    <span class="kw">except</span> <span class="ot">Exception</span>:
        <span class="kw">assert</span> <span class="ot">False</span>, <span class="st">&#39;Function did not raise correct kind of exception for invalid rectangle&#39;</span></code></pre>
<p>The logic in this second version may take a moment to work out, but the idea is straightforward: we want to check that <code>rectangle_area</code> raises a <code>ValueError</code> exception if it’s given a rectangle whose upper edge is below or to the left of its lower edge.</p>
<p>Here’s another test case that can help us design our software:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> test_zero_width():
    <span class="kw">assert</span> rectangle_area([<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">8</span>]) == <span class="dv">0</span></code></pre>
<p>We might decide that rectangles with negative areas aren’t allowed, but what about rectangles with zero area, i.e., rectangles that are actually lines? Any actual implementation of <code>rectangle_area</code> will do <em>something</em> with one of these; writing unit tests for boundary cases is a good way to specify exactly what that something is.</p>
<p>Unit tests are actually such a good way to define how functions ought to behave that many programmers use a practice called <em>test-driven development</em> (TDD). Instead of writing code, then figuring out how to test it, these programmers:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>write some unit tests for a function that doesn’t exist yet,</li>
<li>write that function,</li>
<li>modify it until it passes all of the tests, then</li>
<li>clean up the function, i.e., make it more readable or more efficient without breaking any of the tests.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mantra often used during TDD is “<em>red, green, refactor</em>”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a red light (i.e., some failing tests)</li>
<li>Make it turn green (i.e., get something working)</li>
<li>Then clean it up by refactoring</li>
</ul>
<p>This cycle should take anywhere from a couple of minutes to an hour or so. If it takes longer than that, the change being made is probably too large, and should be broken down into smaller (and more comprehensible) steps.</p>
<p>TDD’s proponents argue that it helps people produce better code for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It encourages them to write code in small, self-contained chunks, and to actually write tests for those chunks</li>
<li>It frees them from <em>confirmation bias</em>: since they haven’t written their function yet, their subconscious cannot steer their testing toward proving it correct rather than finding errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Empirical studies of TDD have had mixed results: some have found it beneficial, while others have found no effect. But even if you don’t use it day to day, trying it a few times helps you learn how to design functions and programs that are easier to test.</p>
