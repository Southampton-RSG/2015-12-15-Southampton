<p>As soon as people can work in <strong>parallel</strong>, someone is going to step on someone else’s toes.</p>
<p>This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make different changes to each copy.</p>
<p>These situations are called <strong>conflicts</strong> Version control helps us manage these <a href="reference.html#conflicts">conflicts</a> by giving us tools to <a href="reference.html#resolve">resolve</a> overlapping changes.</p>
<p>To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one. The file <code>rainfall_conversion.py</code> currently looks like this in both partners’ copies of our <code>climate-analysis</code> repository:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cat</span> rainfall_conversion.py</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;A library to perform rainfall unit conversions&quot;&quot;&quot;

def inches_to_mm(inches):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Convert inches to milimetres.

    Arguments:
    inches -- the rainfall inches
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    mm = inches * 25.4
    return mm</code></pre>
<h3 id="developer-a---modify-and-push">Developer A - Modify and Push</h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/slides/version-control-with-git-slides%20-%2025.jpg" alt="Conflicts" /><p class="caption">Conflicts</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s add a line to the bottom of Developer A’s copy only:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">nano</span> rainfall_conversion.py
$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;A library to perform rainfall unit conversions&quot;&quot;&quot;

def inches_to_mm(inches):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Convert inches to milimetres.

    Arguments:
    inches -- the rainfall inches
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    mm = inches * 25.4
    return mm

# TODO(Developer B): Add function to convert from inches to centimetres</code></pre>
<p>and then push the change to GitHub:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Developer A added a line&quot;</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>[master 5ae9631] Developer A added a line

<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> push origin master</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Counting objects: 5, done.

<h3 id="developer-b---modify-and-push-without-pull">Developer B - Modify and push without pull</h3>
<p>Now let’s have Developer B make a different change to their copy <em>without</em> updating (pulling) from GitHub:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">nano</span> mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
This was added by Dev B</code></pre>
<p>We can commit the change locally:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Developer B added a different line&quot;</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>[master 07ebc69] Developer B added a different line
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</code></pre>
<p>but Git won’t let us push it to GitHub:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> push origin master</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git

</div>
<p>Git <strong>detects</strong> that the <strong>changes</strong> made in one copy <strong>overlap</strong> with those made in the other and <strong>stops us from trampling</strong> on our collaborators work.</p>
<p>What we have to do is <strong>pull</strong> the changes from GitHub, <a href="reference.html#merge">merge</a> them into the copy we’re currently working in, and <strong>then push</strong> that.</p>
<h3 id="developer-b---pull-and-resolve">Developer B - Pull and resolve</h3>
<p>Let’s start by pulling: <sub>~</sub> {.bash} $ git pull origin master <sub><sub><sub> </sub></sub></sub> {.output} remote: Counting objects: 5, done.<br />remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.<br />remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1)<br />Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done. From https://github.com/vlad/planets * branch master -&gt; FETCH_HEAD Auto-merging mars.txt CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in mars.txt Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result. <sub>~</sub></p>
<p><code>git pull</code> tells us there’s a <strong>conflict</strong>, and marks that conflict in the affected file:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
This was added by Dev B
=======
Developer A added this line
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d</code></pre>
<p>Our change—the one in <code>HEAD</code>—is preceded by <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>. Git has then inserted <code>=======</code> as a separator between the conflicting changes and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. (The string of letters and digits after that marker identifies the revision we’ve just downloaded.)</p>
<p>It is now <strong>up to us</strong> to <strong>edit</strong> this file to <strong>remove these markers</strong> and <strong>reconcile the changes</strong>.</p>
<p>We can do anything we want: <strong>keep the change made in the local repository</strong>, <strong>keep the change made in the remote repository</strong>, write something new to <strong>replace both</strong>, or <strong>get rid of the change</strong> entirely.</p>
<p>Let’s <strong>replace</strong> both so that the file looks like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line</code></pre>
<h3 id="developer-b---add-commit-and-push">Developer B - Add, Commit and Push</h3>
<p>To finish merging, we add <code>mars.txt</code> to the changes being made by the merge and then commit:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
# All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
#   (use &quot;git commit&quot; to conclude merge)

<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Merging changes from GitHub&quot;</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>[master 2abf2b1] Merging changes from GitHub</code></pre>
<p>Now we can push our changes to GitHub:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> push origin master</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Counting objects: 10, done.

<p>Git keeps track of what we’ve merged with what, so we don’t have to fix things by hand again when <strong>Developer A</strong> who made the first change pulls again:</p>

<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> pull origin master</code></pre>

<p>we get the merged file:</p>

<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color

<p>We don’t need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.</p>
<p>Version control’s ability to merge conflicting changes is another reason users tend to divide their programs and papers into multiple files instead of storing everything in one large file. There’s another benefit too: whenever there are repeated conflicts in a particular file, the version control system is essentially trying to tell its users that they ought to clarify who’s responsible for what, or find a way to divide the work up differently.</p>
