<p>Version control tools, also known as <strong>revision control</strong> or <strong>source control</strong> tools, track <strong>changes</strong> to files.</p>

<p>We’ve all been in this situation before - it seems ridiculous to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word processors let us deal with this a little better, like Microsoft Word (“Track Changes”) or Google Docs version history.</p>
<p>BUT research isn’t just Words docs. With <strong>Version Control</strong>, at any point in the future, you can retrieve the <strong>correct versions</strong> of your documents, scripts or code. So, for example, a year after publication, you can get hold of the precise combination of scripts and data that you used to assemble a paper.</p>
<p>Version control makes <strong>reproducibility</strong> simpler. If you’re not using version control can you honestly say that your research is reproducible?</p>

<h3 id="a-collaboration-tool">2. A Collaboration Tool</h3>
<p>As well as maintaining a revison history, VC tools also help multiple authors collaborate on the <strong>same file</strong> or set of files.</p>
<p>VC is what <strong>professional software developers</strong> use to work in large <strong>teams</strong> and to keep track of what they’ve done. They know who has changed what and when. And who to blame when things break!</p>
<p>Every large software development project relies on VC, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well.</p>
<p><strong>VC isn’t just for software</strong>: papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time, or needs to be shared can, and probably should be stored in a version control system.</p>
<p>We’ll look at both the backup and collaboration scenarios, but first it’s useful to understand what going on under the hood.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Version control systems start by storing the base version</strong> of the file that you save and then <strong>store just the changes</strong> you made at each step on the way. You can think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and <strong>start</strong> at the base document, then you can <strong>play back</strong> each change and end up with your latest version.</p>

</div>
<p>Once you think of <strong>changes as separate from the document</strong> itself, you can then think about “playing back” different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document. For example, <strong>two users can make independent sets of changes</strong> based on the same document.</p>

</div>
<p>If there aren’t conflicts, you can even try to play two sets of changes onto the same base document. A process call <strong>merging</strong>.</p>

<p>These are the most popular current Version Control systems.</p>
<p><strong>Subversion</strong> has been around since about 2000, it was developed to replace the venerable <strong>Concurrent Versioning System (CVS)</strong> It introduced such revolutionary concepts as the ability to move and rename files whilst retaining their version history.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Mercurial</strong> and <strong>Git</strong> arose from the need to find a new Version Control System for the Linux Kernel, after BitKeeper became non-free in 2005.</p>
<p>Whereas with <strong>Subversion</strong> a single master copy of the repository (the files under version control) exists - the only place where all revision history is kept, <strong>Mercurial</strong> and <strong>Git</strong> are newer and work a little differently - they are <strong>Distributed</strong> Version control systems - each developer in a team has his own copy of the repository which are then synchronised. You can use Git without a network connection and there’s no single point of failuire.</p>
<p><strong>Git</strong> was written by Linus Torvalds (maintainer of the Linux kernel), to scratch his own itch, so if you think it’s idiosyncractic in places, you know who to blame.</p>
<p>Git has found wider prominence partly through the rise of <strong>GitHub</strong> - a web based Git repository hosting service. GitHub also provide bells and whistles like <strong>bug tracking</strong>, <strong>task management</strong> and other tools for managing software projects.</p>
<p>You don’t <strong>need</strong> to use GitHub to employ Git, but we will use it today to demonstrate the use of remote repositories.</p>
