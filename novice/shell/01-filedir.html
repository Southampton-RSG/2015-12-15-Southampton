<p>The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories is called the <strong>file system</strong>. It organizes our data into files, which hold information, and directories (also called “folders”, for example, on Windows systems), which hold files or other directories.</p>
<p>Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. To start exploring them, let’s open a shell window:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$</code></pre>
<p>The dollar sign is a <strong>prompt</strong>, which represents our input interface to the shell. It shows us that the shell is waiting for input; your shell may show something more elaborate.</p>
<p>Type the command <code>whoami</code>, then press the Enter key (sometimes called Return) to send the command to the shell. The command’s output is the ID of the current user, i.e., it shows us who the shell thinks we are:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">whoami</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>nelle</code></pre>
<p>More specifically, when we type <code>whoami</code> the shell:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>finds a program called <code>whoami</code>,</li>
<li>runs that program,</li>
<li>displays that program’s output, then</li>
<li>displays a new prompt to tell us that it’s ready for more commands.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, let’s find out where we are by running a command called <code>pwd</code> (which stands for “print working directory”). At any moment, our <strong>current working directory</strong> is our current default directory, i.e., the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in unless we explicitly specify something else. Here, the computer’s response is <code>/Users/nelle</code>, which is Nelle’s <strong>home directory</strong>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">pwd</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle</code></pre>
<aside class="callout panel panel-info">

<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Home directory</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>The home directory path will look different on different operating systems. On Linux it will look like <code>/home/nelle</code>, on Git Bash on Windows it will look like <code>/c/Users/nelle</code>, and on Windows itself it will be similar to <code>C:\Documents and Settings\nelle</code>. Note that it may also look slightly different for different versions of Windows.</p>

<p>If the command to find out who we are is <code>whoami</code>, the command to find out where we are ought to be called <code>whereami</code>, so why is it <code>pwd</code> instead? The usual answer is that in the early 1970s, when Unix was first being developed, every keystroke counted: the devices of the day were slow, and backspacing on a teletype was so painful that cutting the number of keystrokes in order to cut the number of typing mistakes was actually a win for usability. The reality is that commands were added to Unix one by one, without any master plan, by people who were immersed in its jargon. The result is as inconsistent as the roolz uv Inglish speling, but we’re stuck with it now.</p>

<p>We can move to the beginning of a line in the shell by typing <code>^A</code> (which means Control-A) and to the end using <code>^E</code>. Much quicker on long lines than just using the left/right arrow keys.</p>
<p>Using the up and down arrow keys allow you to cycle through your previous commands - plus, useful if you forget exactly what you typed earlier!</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>To understand what a “home directory” is, let’s have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized. At the top is the <strong>root directory</strong> that holds everything else. We refer to it using a slash character <code>/</code> on its own; this is the leading slash in <code>/Users/nelle</code>.</p>
<p>Inside that directory are several other directories, e.g.: <code>bin</code> (which is where some built-in programs are stored), <code>data</code> (for miscellaneous data files), <code>Users</code> (where users’ personal directories are located), <code>tmp</code> (for temporary files that don’t need to be stored long-term), and so on:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/filesystem.svg" alt="The File System" /><p class="caption">The File System</p>
</div>
<p>We know that our current working directory <code>/Users/nelle</code> is stored inside <code>/Users</code> because <code>/Users</code> is the first part of its name. Similarly, we know that <code>/Users</code> is stored inside the root directory <code>/</code> because its name begins with <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>Underneath <code>/Users</code>, we find one directory for each user with an account on this machine, e.g.: <code>/Users/imhotep</code>, <code>/Users/larry</code>, and ours in <code>/Users/nelle</code>, which is why <code>nelle</code> is the last part of the directory’s name.</p>

<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Path</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>Notice that there are two meanings for the <code>/</code> character. When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to the root directory. When it appears <em>inside</em> a name, it’s just a separator.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>Let’s see what’s in our home directory by running <code>ls</code>, which stands for “listing” (the <code>...</code> refers to other files and directories that have been left out for clarity):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>2015-09-17-southampton Misc                   Solar.pdf
Applications           Movies                 Teaching
Desktop                Music                  ThunderbirdTemp

Downloads              Pizza.cfg              mbox
...</code></pre>
<p>Of course, this listing will depend on what you have in your own home directory.</p>
<p>We need to get into the repository directory <code>2015-09-17-southampton</code>, so what if we want to change our current working directory? Before we do this, <code>pwd</code> shows us that we’re in <code>/Users/nelle</code>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">pwd</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle</code></pre>
<p>We can use <code>cd</code> followed by a directory name to change our working directory. <code>cd</code> stands for “change directory”, which is a bit misleading: the command doesn’t change the directory, it changes the shell’s idea of what directory we are in.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cd</span> 2015-09-17-southampton</code></pre>
<p><code>cd</code> doesn’t print anything, but if we run <code>pwd</code> after it, we can see that we are now in <code>/Users/nelle/2015-09-17-southampton</code>. If we run <code>ls</code> without arguments now, it lists the contents of <code>/Users/nelle/2015-09-17-southampton</code>, because that’s where we now are:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">pwd</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle/2015-09-17-southampton</code></pre>
<!-- ![Nelle's Home Directory](fig/homedir.svg) - remove Desktop-->

<p><code>ls</code> prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order, arranged neatly into columns (where there is space to do so). We can make its output more comprehensible by using the <strong>flag</strong> <code>-F</code>, which tells <code>ls</code> to add a trailing <code>/</code> to the names of directories:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>CONDUCT.md              _config.yml             prerequisites.html

<p>Here, we can see that this directory contains a number of <strong>sub-directories</strong>. The names that don’t have trailing slashes, like <code>reference.html</code>, <code>prerequisites.md</code>, and <code>preqrequisites.pdf</code>, are plain old files. And note that there is a space between <code>ls</code> and <code>-F</code>: without it, the shell thinks we’re trying to run a command called <code>ls-F</code>, which doesn’t exist.</p>
<aside class="callout panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>What’s In A Name?</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>You may have noticed that all of these files’ names are “something dot something”. This is just a convention: we can call a file <code>mythesis</code> or almost anything else we want. However, most people use two-part names most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the <strong>filename extension</strong>, and indicates what type of data the file holds: <code>.txt</code> signals a plain text file, <code>.pdf</code> indicates a PDF document, <code>.html</code> is an HTML file, and so on.</p>
<p>This is just a convention, albeit an important one. Files contain bytes: it’s up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes according to the rules for PDF documents, images, and so on.</p>
<p>Naming a PNG image of a whale as <code>whale.mp3</code> doesn’t somehow magically turn it into a recording of whalesong, though it <em>might</em> cause the operating system to try to open it with a music player when someone double-clicks it.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>For this exercise, we need to change our working directory to <code>novice</code>, and then <code>shell</code> (within the <code>novice</code> directory). We can do this by:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cd</span> novice/shell</code></pre>
<p>Note that we are able to add directories together by using <code>/</code>. Now if we view the contents of that directory:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>00-intro.html          AUTHORS                img/

06-find.md             fig/                   tools/</code></pre>
<p>Note that under Git Bash in Windows, the <code>/</code> is appended automatically.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at what’s in the directory <code>test_directory</code>, by running <code>ls -F test_directory</code>.</p>
<p>i.e., the command <code>ls</code> with the <strong>arguments</strong> <code>-F</code> and <code>test_directory</code>. The second argument — the one <em>without</em> a leading dash — tells <code>ls</code> that we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F test_directory</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>creatures/          molecules/          notes.txt           solar.pdf
data/               north-pacific-gyre/ pizza.cfg           writing/</code></pre>
<p>The output shows us that there are some files and sub-directories. Organising things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work: it’s a bit like using a filing cabinet to store things. It’s possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory, for example, just as it’s possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk, but it’s a self-defeating strategy.</p>
<p>Notice, by the way, that we spelled the directory name <code>test_directory</code>. It doesn’t have a trailing slash: that’s added to directory names by <code>ls</code> when we use the <code>-F</code> flag to help us tell things apart. And it doesn’t begin with a slash because it’s a <strong>relative path</strong>, i.e., it tells <code>ls</code> how to find something from where we are, rather than from the root of the file system.</p>
<aside class="callout panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Parameters vs. Arguments</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Parameters_and_arguments">Wikipedia</a>, the terms argument and <strong>parameter</strong> mean slightly different things. In practice, however, most people use them interchangeably or inconsistently, so we will too.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>If we run <code>ls -F /test_directory</code> (<em>with</em> a leading slash) we get a different response, because <code>/test_directory</code> is an <strong>absolute path</strong>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F /test_directory</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>ls: /test_directory: No such file or directory</code></pre>
<p>The leading <code>/</code> tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory, no matter where we are when we run the command. In this case, there is no <code>data</code> directory in the root of the file system.</p>
<p>Typing <code>ls -F test_directory</code> is a bit painful, so a handy shortcut is to type in the first few letters and press the <em>TAB</em> key, e.g.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F tes</code></pre>
<p>Pressing <em>TAB</em>, the shell automatically completes the directory name:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F test_directory/</code></pre>
<p>This is known as <em>tab completion</em> on any matches with those first few letters. If there are more than one files or directories that match those letters, the shell will show you both — you can then enter more characters (then using <em>TAB</em> again) until it is able to identify the precise file you want and finish the tab completion.</p>
<p>Let’s change our directory to <code>test_directory</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cd</span> test_directory</code></pre>
<p>We know how to go down the directory tree: but how do we go up? We could use an absolute path, e.g. <code>cd /Users/nelle/2015-09-17-southampton/novice/shell</code>.</p>
<p>but it’s almost always simpler to use <code>cd ..</code> to go up one level:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">pwd</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle/2015-09-17-southampton/novice/shell/test_directory</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cd</span> ..</code></pre>
<p><code>..</code> is a special directory name meaning “the directory containing this one”, or more succinctly, the <strong>parent</strong> of the current directory.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">pwd</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle/2015-09-17-southampton/novice/shell/</code></pre>
<p>Let’s go back into our test directory:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cd</span> test_directory</code></pre>
<p>The special directory <code>..</code> doesn’t usually show up when we run <code>ls</code>. If we want to display it, we can give <code>ls</code> the <code>-a</code> flag:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F -a</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>./                  data/               notes.txt           writing/
../                 molecules/          pizza.cfg
creatures/          north-pacific-gyre/ solar.pdf</code></pre>
<p><code>-a</code> stands for “show all”; it forces <code>ls</code> to show us file and directory names that begin with <code>.</code>, such as <code>..</code> (which, if we’re in <code>/Users/nelle/2015-09-17-southampton/shell/novice/test_directory</code>, refers to the <code>/Users/nelle/2015-09-17-southampton/2015-09-17-southampton/novice/shell/</code> directory). As you can see, it also displays another special directory that’s just called <code>.</code>, which means “the current working directory”. It may seem redundant to have a name for it, but we’ll see some uses for it soon.</p>
<aside class="callout panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Orthogonality</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>The special names <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> don’t belong to <code>ls</code>; they are interpreted the same way by every program. For example, if we are in <code>/Users/nelle/2015-09-17-southampton</code>, the command <code>ls ..</code> will give us a listing of <code>/Users/nelle</code>. When the meanings of the parts are the same no matter how they’re combined, programmers say they are <strong>orthogonal</strong>: Orthogonal systems tend to be easier for people to learn because there are fewer special cases and exceptions to keep track of.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<aside class="callout panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Another Useful Abbreviation</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>The shell interprets the character <code>~</code> (tilde) at the start of a path to mean “the current user’s home directory”. For example, if Nelle’s home directory is <code>/Users/nelle</code>, then <code>~/data</code> is equivalent to <code>/Users/nelle/data</code>. This only works if it is the first character in the path: <code>here/there/~/elsewhere</code> is <em>not</em> <code>/Users/nelle/elsewhere</code>.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>Another handy feature is that we can reference our home directory with <code>~</code>, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> ~/2015-09-17-southampton</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>CONDUCT.md              _config.yml             prerequisites.html
